# Intelligent Chatbot Application

Welcome to the Intelligent Chatbot Application! This Streamlit-based chatbot utilizes OpenAI's GPT models for generating responses and Pinecone's vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings. It's designed to provide users with intelligent responses based on the content from indexed documents loaded into Pinecone.

## Features

- **Web-Based Document Loading**: Upload PDF documents directly through the interface for indexing.
- **Intelligent Response Generation**: Utilize OpenAI's powerful models to generate context-aware responses to user queries.
- **Embedding Storage and Retrieval**: Leverage Pinecone's serverless vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of text embeddings, enhancing the response quality based on relevant document content.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to OpenAI's API
- Access to Pinecone's API
- An internet connection for accessing APIs and handling document uploads

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository name]
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix or MacOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set your API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   export PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Uploading PDF Documents
1. Use the file uploader in the sidebar to upload PDF documents for indexing.
2. The uploaded documents will be processed and stored in Pinecone for quick retrieval.

### Fetching Web Content
1. Enter URLs in the text area and click "Fetch Web Content" to fetch and analyze web page content.
2. The content, sentiment, and summary will be displayed for each URL.

### Interacting with the Chatbot
1. Use the chat input at the bottom of the interface to ask questions or initiate conversations with the chatbot.
2. The chatbot will generate responses based on the indexed documents and web content.

## Example Interaction

**User**: "Can you provide a summary of document XYZ?"  
**Chatbot**: "Here is a summary of document XYZ..."

## Adding Animations


1. **Install the library**:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit-animated-title
   ```

2. **Use it in your Streamlit app**:
   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   from streamlit_animated_title import animated_title

   animated_title("Intelligent Chatbot Application")
   ```

## Integrating RAG Model

Integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model can significantly enhance the chatbot's capabilities by providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

1. **Install the necessary libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers
   ```

2. **Update your application to use the RAG model**:
   ```python
   from transformers import RagTokenizer, RagRetriever, RagTokenForGeneration

   # Initialize the RAG model components
   tokenizer = RagTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/rag-token-base')
   retriever = RagRetriever.from_pretrained('facebook/rag-token-base')
   model = RagTokenForGeneration.from_pretrained('facebook/rag-token-base', retriever=retriever)

   # Example function to generate responses using RAG
   def generate_rag_response(query):
       inputs = tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt")
       generated = model.generate(**inputs)
       return tokenizer.batch_decode(generated, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]

   # Use the RAG model in your chat handling code
   user_query = "Your query here"
   response = generate_rag_response(user_query)
   st.write(response)
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Store API keys securely using environment variables and avoid hardcoding them in the code.
- Ensure proper access controls are in place to protect sensitive data.

## Error Handling

- Errors during document uploads, API requests, or user queries are handled gracefully, providing informative messages to the user.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional document formats beyond PDF.
- Integration with other AI models for sentiment analysis and summarization.
- User customization options for chatbot behavior and preferences.

## Deployment Options

- Deploy the application in production environments with considerations for scalability, resource utilization, and server setup.
